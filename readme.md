## Project Title
**CollaborativeArt: A Decentralized Collaborative Art Platform**

## Project Description
CollaborativeArt is a blockchain-based platform where creators and contributors collaborate to create unique works of art. Creators can propose ideas for artwork and incentivize participation by funding a reward pool. Contributors can submit their creative input to these artworks, and upon completion, rewards are distributed proportionally among contributors. The platform ensures transparency, fairness, and decentralization by leveraging smart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain.
